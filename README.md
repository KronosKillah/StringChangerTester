# StringChangerTester
The tool(s) i use to test string changing, and to help the development of my StringChaning Tool.

The tool has these Tools included in it
- ByteArray Maker
- JsonSetting Maker
- ImportantOffsets4NetCheat
The Bye array maker was what i used before i built it into the main tool

The JSON setting maker is the tool i used to make the JSON file loading config thing work (will understand how it works if you know how JSON thing works for C#)

and the important offsets are for easy access for when using Netcheat, for BO2 and MW3.
